# HarmptorPrint

Welcome to HarmptorPrint!

To download the program, please [click here](https://github.com/harmptor/HarmptorPrint/releases/download/v0.3/HarmptorPrint_v0.3.exe) or visit the [releases](https://github.com/harmptor/HarmptorPrint/releases/latest) section and download the .exe from there.

I'll give a short intro on how the program works.
Versions 0.x are designed to walk you thru the process, similar to a wizard. Several popups are gonna show up and ask for your input. In the background a console is going to log everything that's going on.

Versions 1.x are going to have a proper user interface with buttons and selectors. [borat voice] Very Nais!

Back to version 0 tho. First thing that's gonna pop up is the window where you select the file you're trying to print:

Next is your login data. It's the same user&pass you use to log onto those crusty old machines in GS-Pool. Search for "ZDI Account" in your st-mail inbox if you don't know what I'm talking about.

Enter your username (jonesjy for Jimmy Jones) and corresponding password:

Once you click OK, HarmptorPrint queries all available printers and asks which one it should print on. Select your preference:

Made your choice? Perfect!

Second to last, you're asked whether you want to actually print the document, or if you're just testing the waters and want to pipe the command to your logfile instead. If you don't know what that means, don't worry, you don\t need to. Press button machine go brrrrrr. Or select `print` if you're ready to pick up your stuff from the printer. Mind you this is going to work regardless of whether you're currently at uni or not, so be careful with what you print lol!

(Future versions starting v1.X will have a button to view the logs)

Lastly, a confirmation window will pop up with a friendly reminder to save our trees. If you actually printed a file, a print job ID associated with your session is going to be displayed. Otherwise it's gonna display this notice:

Confirming `I will!` will do the same thing as hitting `X` on any of the windows: exit the program. 

I hope everything works fine. If it doesn't, feel free to open an issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/harmptor/HarmptorPrint/issues).

Much love, Paul (the harmptor guy)
